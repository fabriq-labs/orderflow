# Railway deployment configuration for OrderFlow Marketing Site

# This is a static HTML site served by Python's built-in HTTP server
# Railway will automatically detect this as a Python project

# The marketing-site.html file will be served as the main page
# All assets (CSS, JS) are embedded in the HTML file for simplicity

# Port configuration
# Railway will set the PORT environment variable automatically
# Our start script uses: python3 -m http.server $PORT
